### Enhancements and Additions:

1. **Improved Error Handling and Logging:**
   - More detailed logging for all actions, errors, and API requests/responses. This will aid in debugging and monitoring.
   - Implement a proper error handling mechanism that gracefully handles various exceptions (e.g., API errors, insufficient funds, order failures) and potentially notifies the user (email, Telegram, etc.).
   - Consider using a logging library like `logging` for better structured logging.

2. **Order Status Monitoring:**
   -  Continuously monitor the status of placed orders (especially limit orders) and provide updates or take appropriate actions if orders are not filled within a reasonable time.
   -  Consider implementing a mechanism to reconcile order statuses with exchange records to ensure data consistency.

3. **Position Sizing Strategies:**
   -  Instead of using a fixed percentage of the available balance for each trade, implement more sophisticated position sizing strategies (e.g., fixed dollar amount, percentage of equity, Kelly Criterion) to manage risk more effectively.

4. **Backtesting and Simulation:**
   -  Add the ability to backtest the trading logic on historical data to evaluate its performance and identify potential weaknesses before live trading.
   -  Consider implementing a paper trading mode to simulate trades without risking real capital.

5. **Web Interface or Dashboard:**
   -  Develop a user-friendly web interface or dashboard to monitor the bot's status, view open positions, trade history, and potentially configure settings without restarting the bot.

6. **Security Hardening:**
   -  Store API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system).
   -  Implement security measures like IP whitelisting for webhook requests to prevent unauthorized access.

7. **Code Refactoring and Documentation:**
   -  Refactor code into smaller, more modular functions for better organization and maintainability.
   -  Add more comprehensive docstrings and comments to explain the code's logic and functionality.

8. **Trading Fees:**
   -  Accurately calculate and track trading fees incurred on each trade. This information is crucial for performance evaluation.

9. **Advanced Order Types:**
   -  Consider adding support for other order types like stop-limit orders, trailing stop-limit orders, or iceberg orders for more advanced trading strategies.

10. **Order Book Dynamics:**
    -  Implement logic to analyze order book depth and liquidity before placing orders. Avoid placing large market orders that could significantly impact the price.

### Code Example (Error Handling):

```python
# ... (other imports) ...
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(filename="trading_bot.log", level=logging.INFO, 
                    format="%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")

async def execute_trade(json_data: Dict):
    # ... (existing code) ...
    try:
        # ... (trade execution logic) ...
    except ccxt.NetworkError as e:
        logging.error(f"Network error during trade execution: {e}")
        # Notify user or take other actions
        return f"Network error: {e}", 500
    except ccxt.InsufficientFunds as e:
        logging.error(f"Insufficient funds to execute trade: {e}")
        # ... (handle insufficient funds) ...
    except Exception as e:
        logging.exception(f"Unexpected error during trade execution: {e}")
        # ... (handle unexpected errors) ...
```
